# discourse-archive

A script that provides a basic archive of Discourse contents.

## Install

```sh
% pip install discourse-archive
```

or, if you don't trust package managers:

```sh
% curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesob/discourse-archive/master/archive.py > /on/your/path/discourse-archive
% chmod +x /on/your/path/discourse-archive
```

## Usage

```sh
% discourse-archive --help
usage: discourse-archive [-h] [-u URL] [--debug] [-t TARGET_DIR]

Create a basic content archive from a Discourse installation

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url URL     URL of the Discourse server
  --debug
  -t TARGET_DIR, --target-dir TARGET_DIR
                        Target directory for the archive
```

The structure that it generates looks something like:
```

## Rendering an HTML mirror

Once you have an archive, `mirror.py` renders it into a static HTML site you can
serve anywhere. It reads the per-post JSON under `<target-dir>/posts`, groups the
posts into topics, and writes one minimal, self-contained HTML page per topic
(using Discourse's server-rendered `cooked` HTML) plus a flat `index.html`
listing topics with the most recently active first.

```sh
% ./mirror.py --help
usage: discourse-mirror [-h] [-u URL] [--debug] [-t TARGET_DIR] [-o OUTPUT_DIR]
                        [-s SITE_URL]

Render a static HTML mirror from a Discourse archive

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url URL     URL of the source Discourse server (used to make
                        relative links in the archived HTML absolute)
  --debug
  -t TARGET_DIR, --target-dir TARGET_DIR
                        Directory of the archive to read
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory to write the rendered site into
  -s SITE_URL, --site-url SITE_URL
                        URL where the mirror itself will be deployed (used for
                        og:url tags). Optional.
```

Typical usage, reading the `./archive` produced above and writing the site into
`./site`:

```sh
% ./mirror.py -t ./archive -o ./site -u https://delvingbitcoin.org
```

The `-u`/`--url` value is used to rewrite root-relative links and images in the
archived HTML (e.g. `/u/alice`, `/uploads/...`) back to absolute URLs on the
source server, so they resolve from wherever you host the mirror. It defaults to
the same `DISCOURSE_URL` environment variable / value as `discourse-archive`, so
make sure it matches the site you archived.

The optional `-s`/`--site-url` (or `SITE_URL` env var) is the public URL where
the rendered mirror will be hosted, e.g. `https://archive.example.org`. When
set, it's used for `og:url` meta tags so social previews link back to the
mirror; if omitted, topic pages fall back to pointing `og:url` at the original
Discourse thread (matching their `rel=canonical`) and the index omits `og:url`
entirely.

The generated structure looks like:
```
site
├── index.html
├── 2025-10-13-about-the-meta-category-id1.html
├── 2025-10-14-about-the-research-category-id25.html
└── 2026-06-18-outbound-connection-success-rates-of-a-bitcoin-node-id142.html
```

Re-running is idempotent - it overwrites the output directory in place, so you
can regenerate the mirror after each sync.

### Missing posts

If a topic has a gap in its post numbers (e.g. posts #14 and #16 are archived
but #15 isn't), the mirror renders an inline warning box between the
surrounding posts calling out the gap, rather than silently skipping it.

A gap usually means one of:
- the post hasn't been archived yet, e.g. `discourse-archive` was interrupted
  or hasn't been re-run since the post was made
- the topic was unlisted/hidden at the time of a previous sync and only made public
  later, so its posts were skipped back then
- the post was deleted or removed by moderation on the source site, in which
  case it's gone for good and re-archiving won't bring it back

Since the archive can't tell these cases apart on its own, running a full
resync is worth doing occasionally. It'll fill in gaps caused by missed or
previously-unlisted posts, and any gap that persists after a resync is likely
deleted/moderated.

`discourse-archive` normally does an incremental sync, only fetching posts
created after `last_sync_date` in `<target-dir>/.metadata.json`. To force a
full resync, delete that file before re-running.

Each warning is preceded by an HTML comment `<!-- MIRROR-MISSING-POST -->`,
so you can grep the rendered site for an overview of how many gaps exist.

```sh
% grep -rl MIRROR-MISSING-POST site/ | wc -l   # topics with at least one gap
% grep -ro MIRROR-MISSING-POST site/*.html | wc -l  # total gaps across the mirror
```
